Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


# Titanic Data Analysis

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to clean and analyse the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger demographics, ticket classes, fares, and survival rates.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains details of passengers aboard the Titanic.  
**Key columns:**
- PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
- Survived: 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger name
- Sex: Gender
- Age: Age of the passenger
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Price of the ticket
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualisations (count plots, histograms, bar charts, heatmap)  
5. Observations and Insights

## 📊 Key Insights
- Only ~38% passengers survived.
- Females had much higher survival rates than males.
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Most passengers were between 20–35 years old.
- Higher ticket fares were linked to higher survival chances.
- Strong negative correlation between `Pclass` and `Fare`.
